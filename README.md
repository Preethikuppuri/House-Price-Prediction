# House Price Prediction  

This project predicts house prices based on features like location, size, and number of rooms.  

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Preprocesses housing dataset (cleaning, encoding, scaling)  
- Trains regression models for price prediction  
- Evaluates performance with MAE/RMSE  

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
- Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib  

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works
1. Load housing dataset  
2. Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding)  
3. Train ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
4. Predict house prices
